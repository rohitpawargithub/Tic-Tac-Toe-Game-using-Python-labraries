# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Python

**🌟 Project Overview:**
This is a **classic Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python using popular libraries. It allows **two players** to play interactively on the same computer with a clear visual display of the game board.

**✨ Key Features:**

* ✅ Two-player turn-based game (X vs O)
* ✅ Interactive and user-friendly console or GUI interface
* ✅ Detects **winning conditions** and **draw situations** automatically
* ✅ Uses Python libraries for enhanced functionality and display

**🛠 Technologies & Libraries Used:**

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **NumPy** – Optional for board representation and checks
* **Tkinter / Pygame** – For GUI implementation (if applicable)
* **Random** – Optional for single-player mode with AI

**🎯 Applications:**

* Fun and educational project to practice **Python programming**
* Learn **game logic implementation** and turn-based mechanics
* Introduces basic **GUI programming** (if GUI version implemented)

**⚙ How It Works:**

1. Players take turns marking **X** or **O** on a 3x3 grid.
2. The program checks after each move for a **win** or **draw**.
3. Displays the **updated board** after every turn.
4. Announces the **winner** or **draw** at the end of the game.

**📂 Repository Includes:**

* Python source code (console and/or GUI version)
* Instructions to run the game
* Optional AI mode for single-player experience
